# Job Search App

## Video Demo

## Overview

The Job Search App is a cross-platform application built using React Native, allowing users to search for jobs on both iPhone and Android devices with a single codebase. Unlike native apps built using other frameworks like Flutter, this app eliminates the need to write different code for different platforms. The app leverages Rapid API to fetch available jobs near users and provides detailed information about each job opportunity. It is fast, user-friendly, and offers various features such as filtering jobs based on location and other preferences.

## Features

- Cross-platform: Works seamlessly on both iPhone and Android devices with a single codebase

- Fast and efficient: Provides a smooth and responsive user experience
- Job filtering: Allows users to filter jobs based on their preferences, such as location, job type, and more
- Detailed job information: Displays comprehensive job details, including company name, job description, and application link

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: The main framework used for building the cross-platform application, allowing for a single codebase that works on both iPhone and Android devices
